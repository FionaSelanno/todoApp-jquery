#Introduction:
After following a tutorial on [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/introduction-to-jquery-2884)
from Sachin Bhatnagar about jQuery. I decided to make this app to play around with jQuery code. IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!

    - A user should be able to add items to the list.
    - A user should be able to check items off the list if they are done.
    - A user should see a summary of total added items, total checked off items, total items still to do.
    - A user should clean up all the checkoff items from the list.
    
#Steps I've taken so far:
1. Setup the app => I used JQeury from CDN, and putted all the jqeury code in a separate Javascript file in order to keep html, styling(css) and js code separate from each other.
2. Get input from the user and print the input=> see commit [38edae0](https://github.com/FionaSelanno/todoApp-jquery/commit/38edae09ab983ff66f2f272ae5de42e77c1812af).
